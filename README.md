# FluxCraft

**FluxCraft** is a flexible data pipeline builder that lets you define transformations using **cells** and **SQL expressions**. <br/>
It allows you to **design pipelines interactively**, then **export and run them repeatedly on new data, in multiple languages**.

---

## 🚀 What You Can Do

✅ Build pipelines interactively in real time<br/>
✅ Write transformations using SQL or visual cell steps<br/>
✅ Load sample data from files or HTTP<br/>
✅ See instant results as you design<br/>
✅ Export pipeline definitions (e.g. to Java)<br/>
✅ Run pipelines repeatedly on multiple datasets<br/>
✅ Powered by Rust + Polars for high performance<br/>

## 🔄 How FluxCraft Works

1. **Design your pipeline in real time**

   - Load data from a file or HTTP endpoint
   - Add cells and write SQL-like transformations
   - Preview results instantly

2. **Refine and validate the pipeline**

   - Tweak steps interactively
   - Ensure correctness before exporting

3. **Export the pipeline**

   - Generate a language-agnostic definition
   - Load it into other runtimes (e.g. Java)

4. **Run it repeatedly on new data**

   - Apply the same logic to multiple files or sources
   - Automate recurring processing at scale

## 🧠 Why FluxCraft?

- Combines SQL expressiveness with modular pipeline building
- Supports both code and UI-based transformations
- High performance through Rust and Polars
- Easy to integrate into existing systems and languages
- Built for data engineers, developers, and automation workflows

---

## 🧩 Roadmap Highlights

- **Condition/validation** checks for pipeline outputs
- **Datasource connectors** (Postgres, Kafka, etc.)

---

## 💡 Long-Term Vision

FluxCraft aims to become a **unified workspace for data workflows**, bringing together:

- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) / data pipelines
- SQL transformations
- Interactive visualization
- Cross-language portability and automation
